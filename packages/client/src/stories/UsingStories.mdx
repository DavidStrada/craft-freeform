# Using Stories in Freeform

To use stories in Freeform, you would write stories in the same folder as the component,
by making a new file with the `.stories.tsx` suffix.

For instance if you have a component in `src/components/my-component.tsx`, you would write
stories for it in `src/components/my-component.stories.tsx` file.
